# Infos and requirements 

This is a repository with all my conky config. You can use it if you want !
The center circle and the clock come from here:
https://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Conky+lua?content=139024

PS: All the directories start from home, so if you want to use it, change the user name afer "/home". I know it will be long, but the "~/" shortcut wasn't working. I will try to correct that soon !
